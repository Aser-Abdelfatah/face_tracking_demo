# Face Tracking Demo with Swift YOLO on XIAO and Grove AI Vision Board v2

---
This repository contains an Arduino sketch (`face_tracking_swift_yolo_XIAO_Grove_vision_board.ino`) that implements face tracking using a Swift-based YOLO model on the Seeed XIAO board connected to Grove AI Vision Board v2 for model inference. It's a quick demo, made for ARCS lab at Pomona College.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aser-Abdelfatah/face_tracking_demo.git
   ```
2. **Open the `.ino` file** in the Arduino IDE.
3. **Connect your XIAO Grove Vision Board** to your computer.
4. **Upload the sketch** to the board.
5. **Observe real-time face tracking** on the connected display.
